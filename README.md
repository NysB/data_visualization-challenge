This repository contains my homework for Module 5.

## Attachments
In this reposity, you will find:
- a folder called "Data" containing the data received for the homework
- A file called "pymaceuticals_starter" containing the code written for this analysis.

## Result
The task was to analyze the data from an animal study on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study, 249 mice were treated with a range of drug regimens over 45 days, during which tumor development was measured. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of Capomulin against other treatment regimens.

The following observations were noted:
1. One duplicate mouse ID was found and therefore deleted from the data;
1. Based on the last measurement for each mouse, only the Infubinol treatment showed outliers;
2. A clear negative trend was visible, when looking at the Tumor Volume over all timepoints for the Capomulin treatment for mouse S185;
3. The data show that there is a strong correlation (i.e. 84%) between Weight and Tumor Volume for the Capomulin regimen.
