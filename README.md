# Data Visualization Challenge
This repository contains my homework for Module 5.

## Attachments
In this reposity, you will find:
- a folder called "Data" containing the data received for the homework
- A file called "pymaceuticals_starter" containing the code written for this analysis.

## Result
Following the analysis, I have made the following observations:
1. Based on the latest Timepoint for each mouse, only the Infubinol treatment has an outlier;
2. We can see a clear negative trend, when looking at the Tumor Volume over the Timepoints for the Capomulin treatment for mouse S185;
3. The data show that there is a strong correlation (i.e. 84%) between Weight and Tumor Volume for the Capomulin regimen.
